recursion - function calling itself

when to use - when problem can be devided into sub problem

recursive leap of faith - 

recursion tree for factorial N 5 >4 >3 >2 >1> 1*2>2*3>6*4>24*5>120

recursion call stacl 5|4|3|2|1  follow last in first out

recursion vs iteration - things done recursively can be done iteratively, iteration only has assending phase while recursion has desending phase

Base condition : last valid input, first invalid input
