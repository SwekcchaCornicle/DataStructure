What is backtracking?
    allgo approch to find sol to problem that involve many path.
    sol are built up step by step recursion.
    controlled recurssion.

How is diffren from recursion.
    controlled recursion + modify state of problem in place + abondend path that don't lead sol.


pass by refrence or change in place
    'abc' > crate new array and get all permutation
    backtracking > changes in place  no nee d to create new array


Bluprint to solve backtracking 
    func()
    {
    if solved > return or print sol
    for choice in choice:
    {
        if is valid choice
        {
        choose
        func()
        revert choice > when choice not leading to valid path
        }
    }
    }
    func()


Identify when to use backtracking
    if problem require every possible path
    if there are multiple choice you want to achive all.
